## AI usage

Uses generative AI (mostly [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)), for research and for learning new tools and validating ideas. The way search engines once worked, before noise replaced signal.

Writes without AI. No emails. No notes. No drafts. No books. No comments. Nothing that claims to be mine is written by anyone — or anything — else.

Believes in the act of writing. Of thinking by hand. Of shaping words slowly. "It’s about being, not having."

Uses AI to explain code. SQL, Python, Go, JavaScript. Small functions. Educational. Adapted by hand before use.

Asks questions while writing. Like asking a friend nearby.
“What is impossible to prove but shapes belief?”
“Which trades still use a physical toolbox?”

But the words are mine.

If this ever changes, I will say so. Here: [alleksy.com/ai](https://alleksy.com/ai)
