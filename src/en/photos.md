## Through My Lens üì∏

Photography is my way of capturing fleeting moments and finding beauty in the everyday. From bustling city streets to quiet natural corners, I'm always looking for stories to tell through images.

### Camera Setup üì∑

<div class="camera-info">
<strong>Primary Kit:</strong> Currently shooting with a Fujifilm X-T4 paired with a 35mm f/1.4 lens for most street photography. I also carry a compact film camera (Olympus mju-ii) for those special analog moments that digital just can't capture.

<strong>Philosophy:</strong> I believe the best camera is the one you have with you. While I love my gear, some of my favorite shots have come from just paying attention to the world around me, regardless of the equipment.

### Photography Philosophy üéØ

**Patience Over Perfection:** The best shots often require waiting for the right moment rather than forcing it.

**Story Over Technical:** While I love sharp images and perfect exposure, I'm more interested in photos that tell a story or evoke emotion.

**Film and Digital:** Each medium has its place. Digital for experimentation and quick iteration, film for slowing down and being more intentional.

**Respect for Subjects:** Whether photographing people or places, I always try to approach with respect and genuine curiosity.

### Current Projects üìã

- **"Daily Walks" Series** - Documenting the changing light and mood of my neighborhood throughout the seasons
- **Film Photography Challenge** - Shooting only film for the entire month of April
- **Street Portrait Project** - Building confidence in approaching strangers for environmental portraits

### Photo Communities ü§ù

I'm active in several photography communities:
- Local photography meetup group
- Online film photography forums
- Instagram photography challenges
- Monthly photo walk organizer
