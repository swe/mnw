### Dry facts

My name is Iván, and I am a Russian-born, Swedish-raised Security Engineer and Researcher living and working in Vancouver, BC, Canada. I have a deep interest in internationalization and localization, ciphering and quantum technologies.

This website serves as an online space for documenting and archiving various projects I'm involved with, as well as sharing exploration, research, and experiences accumulated along the way. You can read more about the technical details of the site in the [Colophon](/colophon/).

For the last years, I've been working with [Svalbard Security](https://svalbard.ca/), a boutique cybersecurity studio. Before that, among other things, I've been the technical lead of CloudRAN team for [Ericsson](https://ericsson.com) in Stockholm, and Cyber Defence Manager for [Vancouver Community College](https://vcc.ca/).

### But also

I am much more than my work. In 2022, I moved myself to Vancouver after realizing I like the Canadian vibe. Here I indulge in long city walks, long ocean swims, long trail runs and long village walks. Sitting on a bench in the middle of nowhere is my happy place. I've got a camera with me most of the time, drink lots of coffee and am perfecting my French.
