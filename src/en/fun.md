## Things That Drive Me Crazy 😤

Let's be honest - some things in this world are just poorly designed, unnecessarily complicated, or downright annoying. This isn't about spreading negativity, but rather about identifying problems that could (and should) be solved better. Consider this constructive criticism from someone who cares about good design and user experience.

### 1. **Websites That Auto-Play Videos** 🔇
Nothing kills the browsing experience faster than sudden, unexpected audio blasting from a website. It's 2025 - we should know better by now.

### 2. **Subscription Services for Everything** 💸
When did we decide that every single app, service, and tool needs to be a monthly subscription? Sometimes I just want to buy something once and own it.

### 3. **Confirmation Emails That Arrive Hours Later** ⏰
You've just made a purchase or signed up for something, and then you wait... and wait... for a confirmation that should be instant. It's not 1995 anymore.

### 4. **Printers (All of Them)** 🖨️
They never work when you need them most. The ink is always low. The paper jams. The drivers are mysteriously corrupted. It's like they're designed to fail.

### 5. **Websites That Break the Back Button** ⬅️
Few things are more frustrating than clicking back and finding yourself trapped in some weird navigation loop or redirect chain. Respect the back button!

### 6. **Forced App Downloads for Basic Web Tasks** 📱
"For the best experience, download our app!" No, thank you. I just want to check your menu or store hours. Your mobile website should work perfectly fine.

### 7. **Email Newsletters I Never Signed Up For** 📧
Somehow my email ended up on seventeen different marketing lists, and each unsubscribe process requires PhD-level detective work to complete.

### 8. **Parking Meters That Only Accept Exact Change** 🪙
In an age of contactless payments, requiring exact coins feels like a deliberate inconvenience. Modernize your payment systems!

### 9. **Software That Updates and Changes Everything** 🔄
You finally learn where all the features are, and then an update completely reorganizes the interface. Looking at you, every major software company.

### 10. **Captchas That Are Impossible to Solve** 🤖
"Select all the traffic lights" - but what about that tiny corner of a light in the adjacent square? Are motorcycles vehicles? These things are harder than advanced calculus.

### 11. **Websites That Require Password Complexity Rules** 🔒
Must contain 12 characters, 3 numbers, 2 symbols, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, your mother's maiden name, and the tears of a unicorn. Then they store it in plain text anyway.

### 12. **Phone Calls That Could Have Been Emails** ☎️
"Hey, quick question..." followed by a 30-minute conversation that could have been resolved with a two-sentence email. Respect people's time and communication preferences.

### 13. **Social Media Algorithm Bubble Chambers** 🫧
Platforms that show you the same type of content over and over, creating echo chambers instead of exposing you to new ideas and perspectives.

### 14. **Public WiFi With Fake Connection** 📶
Three bars of signal, connected to "FreeWiFi," but every webpage leads to a login portal that never actually works. Just be honest about your internet situation.

### 15. **Customer Service Chatbots That Can't Help** 🤖
"I understand your frustration, but I can only help with basic questions." Translation: "I'm here to prevent you from talking to a human who could actually solve your problem."

*Important note: This list comes from a place of caring about good design and user experience. I believe most of these problems exist because of poor planning, not malicious intent. With better attention to user needs, many of these frustrations could be eliminated.*

### The Flip Side

For every item on this list, there's usually a company or designer who has solved the problem elegantly. That's what gives me hope - when someone cares enough to get it right, these problems can be fixed.

### Got Your Own Frustrations?

I'm sure you have your own list of things that drive you crazy. If you want to commiserate or share your own design pet peeves, feel free to [reach out](mailto:hello@alleksy.com). Sometimes it helps to know we're not alone in our frustrations!
