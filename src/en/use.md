## Things That Spark Joy ✨

Life is full of small pleasures and big inspirations. Here are some things that consistently bring me happiness, wonder, or motivation. This list evolves as I discover new passions and rediscover old ones.

### 1. **The Smell of Old Books** 📚
There's something magical about walking into a used bookstore or library and being greeted by that distinctive smell of aged paper and binding glue. It instantly transports me to a world of possibilities.

### 2. **Perfect Coffee in the Morning** ☕
That first sip of properly brewed coffee when it's exactly the right temperature and strength. It's a small daily ritual that sets the tone for everything that follows.

### 3. **Late Night Coding Sessions** 💻
When the world is quiet and it's just me, my code, and a problem to solve. Time becomes fluid, and suddenly it's 3 AM and I've built something beautiful.

### 4. **Discovering New Music** 🎵
That moment when a song hits just right - whether it's a hidden track from a favorite artist or a completely new genre I've never explored before. Music has this incredible power to shift my entire mood.

### 5. **Analog Photography** 📸
The deliberate process of film photography - the weight of the camera, the careful composition, the anticipation of developing. Digital is convenient, but film is intentional.

### 6. **Well-Designed Interfaces** 🎨
Interfaces that feel intuitive, look beautiful, and solve real problems. When form and function come together perfectly, it's like poetry in pixels.

### 7. **Rainy Days by the Window** 🌧️
The sound of rain on glass, the gray light filtering through clouds, the perfect excuse to stay inside with a book or a creative project. Rainy days feel like permission to slow down.

### 8. **Learning Something Completely New** 🧠
That initial confusion followed by the gradual "aha!" moments when a new concept finally clicks. Whether it's a programming language, a historical period, or a cooking technique.

### 9. **Handwritten Letters** ✍️
In our digital age, receiving actual handwritten correspondence feels like finding treasure. The personal touch, the effort, the physicality of it all.

### 10. **Minimalist Design** 🔲
Spaces, objects, and interfaces that achieve maximum impact with minimum elements. There's something deeply satisfying about elegant simplicity.

### 11. **Night Walks in the City** 🌃
When the day crowds have dispersed and the city reveals its quieter personality. Street lights creating patterns, the occasional late-night conversation drifting from a café.

### 12. **Foreign Films with Subtitles** 🎬
Stories that transport me to completely different worlds and perspectives. There's something about reading subtitles that makes me pay closer attention to every word and gesture.

### 13. **The First Warm Day of Spring** 🌸
After months of cold, that first day when you can step outside without a jacket and feel the sun's warmth on your skin. It's like the world is waking up again.

### 14. **Deep Conversations with Friends** 💬
Those rare conversations that go beyond small talk and dive into ideas, dreams, fears, and philosophies. When time disappears because you're both so engaged in the exchange.

### 15. **The Moment Before Creating** ✨
That pause before starting a new project, writing the first line, or taking the first photograph. It's full of potential and possibility - anything could happen next.

*This list is a living document that grows and changes as I do. Some items might move to my ["I Hate"](/i-hate/) list (though hopefully not the coffee), and new discoveries will certainly be added.*

### What About You?

I'm always curious about what brings joy to other people. If any of these resonate with you, or if you have your own list of beloved things, I'd love to hear about it. Drop me a [note](mailto:hello@alleksy.com)!
