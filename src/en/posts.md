## What I Write About üìù

This blog is where I explore the intersection of creativity and technology. You'll find posts about:

- **AI and Creativity** - How artificial intelligence is changing creative work
- **Web Development** - Technical tutorials and insights from building websites
- **Design Philosophy** - Thoughts on good design, systems thinking, and user experience
- **Photography** - Lessons from shooting both digital and film
- **Books & Learning** - Reviews and insights from my reading journey
- **Creative Process** - Behind-the-scenes looks at how ideas become reality

## Writing Philosophy üí≠

I believe in writing that's honest, practical, and human. Each post is written with care, based on real experience, and designed to be genuinely useful to fellow creators, developers, and curious minds.

I'm not trying to build an audience or optimize for engagement‚Äîthis is simply a place to share what I'm learning and thinking about. If it resonates with you, wonderful. If not, that's okay too.
